# Self-administered EMDR Therapy Web Application

This React-based web application offers accessible mental health resources by incorporating EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) therapy techniques to manage anxiety, trauma responses, and calm the nervous system through self-administered exercises.

## Features

- **Interactive EMDR Tool**: A visual aid that simulates the eye movement technique used in EMDR therapy.
- **Customizable Animation Control**: Users can adjust the frequency of the eye movement simulation measured in Hertz (Hz), which denotes the number of cycles per second.The size of the moving dot can be dynamically adjusted to suit user preferences, enhancing the visual aspect of the EMDR therapy simulation.
- **Advanced Animation**: Utilizes the `animate()` method and `Web Animations API` to create a smooth and continuous back-and-forth movement of the 'therapy' dot.
- **Responsive Interaction**: A collapsible control panel allows for a cleaner user interface while maintaining functionality.
- **Accessibility**: Input fields are designed to be mobile-friendly and accessible, with `inputMode`, `pattern`, and `Tooltip` components for better user guidance.
- **Artistic Elements**: Includes engaging illustrations and designs that contribute to a calming user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully functional across Chrome and Safari browsers on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Educational Resources**: Provides information about EMDR, its effectiveness, and its use.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
